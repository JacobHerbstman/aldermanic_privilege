	abstract = {In 1957 Chicago enacted a Comprehensive Amendment to the Chicago Zoning Ordiance of 1923. In contrast to the hierarchical zoning of the 1923 ordinance, the 1957 ordinance made each zoning category exclusive and mandated the removal of non-conforming uses. This study examines land parcels at the borders between residential and non-residential (commercial or manufacturing) zones, and finds that land values in non-residential zones enjoyed a one-time jump in growth over the time-period 1955—58 during which the 1957 ordinance was adopted. No significant change is detected in land value growth in residential zones. These results suggest that non-residential landowners valued the insurance that the 1957 ordinance provided against mixed land uses more than the value of the option to change land use that was terminated.},

Further, the measures impacted low-income households and minorities particularly. Not all growth-control measures were associated with this change.

	abstract = {I combine data on thousands of parcel-level zoning changes in Chicago with shifts in Alderman-controlled Ward boundaries to study the consequences of decentralized control over land-use regulation. I ﬁnd that local control matters: zoned density is more restrictive near Ward boundaries, where Ward residents stand to beneﬁt less from improved neighborhood amenities, and exogenous increases in within-Ward homeowner share make zoning more inelastic to housing demand. I then integrate endogenous local zoning into a quantitative spatial model, where households sort into neighborhoods and vote on local zoning decisions—ignoring the spillover eﬀects on other neighborhoods. I ﬁnd that the dis-amenities associated with density are more than twice as concentrated as the positive spillover eﬀects, and estimate that centralizing land-use regulation would increase the size of re-zonings by 5.6 p.p. These results emphasize the role that diﬀuse beneﬁts and concentrated costs of density play in community opposition to development.},

I study recent Chicago upzonings that increased allowed densities and reduced parking requirements in a manner exogenous of development plans and neighborhood characteristics. To evaluate outcomes, I use difference-in-differences tests on property transaction prices and housing-unit construction permits. I detect significant, robust increases in values for transactions on parcels that received a boost in allowed building size. I also identify value increases for residential condominiums, indicating that upzoning increased prices of existing housing units. I find no impacts of the reforms, however, on the number of newly permitted dwellings over five years. As such, I demonstrate that the short-term, local-level impacts of upzoning are higher property prices but no additional new housing construction.},

Although urban preservation is proposed as a strategy of community development in two Chicago neighborhoods (Pilsen and Bronzeville), the outcomes vary significantly. The author argues that the distinct boundaries of aldermanic power play a critical role in shaping the policy process of landmark designation. Aldermanic prerogative gives each alderman veto power over the preservation initiatives in his or her ward. The preservation initiatives within one ward are more likely to receive political support than those across multiple wards. By revealing the mismatch of boundaries between wards and community areas, the study demonstrates the negative impact of political fragmentation on urban preservation.},

            Local control of land-use regulation creates a not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) problem that can suppress housing construction, contributing to rising prices and potentially slowing economic growth. I study how increased local control affects housing production by exploiting a common electoral reform—changing from “at-large” to “ward” elections for town council. These reforms, which are not typically motivated by housing markets, shrink each representative’s constituency from the entire town to one ward. Results from a variety of difference-in-differences estimators show that this decentralization decreases housing units permitted by 20\%, with similar effects on multi- and single-family permits. Effects are larger in whiter and higher-income towns.},

Although the bunching approach was originally developed in the context of taxation, it is beginning to find applications in many other areas, such as social security, social insurance, welfare programs, education, regulation, private sector prices, and reference-dependent preferences.

	abstract = {We describe the empirical relationship between local government boundaries and residential segregation in the United States. First, we study recent changes in the distribution of segregation within and between local governments in all metropolitan areas, using census block data on residential demographics over the period 1990–2020. We find that segregation across local government boundaries explains a substantial share of racial stratification, which has changed only little over the last thirty years. Next, we use spatial regression discontinuity methods to distinguish between household sorting due to neighborhood amenities and public goods provided by local governments. The prevalence of demographic discontinuities at local government boundaries suggest that between-jurisdiction segregation patterns cannot be explained solely by proximity to neighborhood amenities. We discuss implications for policy, showing that both between-jurisdiction segregation and jurisdictional discontinuities can partly explain the correlation between total segregation and racial gaps in educational outcomes.
