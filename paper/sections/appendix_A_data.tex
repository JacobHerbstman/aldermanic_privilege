\section{Data and Sample Construction}
\label{sec:appendix_data}

This appendix documents the data sources and sample construction procedures for the analysis.

\subsection{Data Sources}

The analysis draws on several administrative and proprietary datasets:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Cook County Assessor Data}: Sales records, property assessments, and improvement characteristics for residential parcels in Cook County.
\item \textbf{Chicago Building Permits}: Permit applications and processing records for high-discretion permit types requiring aldermanic approval.
\item \textbf{RentHub Rental Listings}: Daily snapshots of rental listings in Chicago from 2014--2025.
\item \textbf{Ward Boundary Shapefiles}: Official ward boundaries for three eras: pre-2015, 2015--2023, and post-2023.
\item \textbf{Census Data}: American Community Survey block group demographics and 2010/2020 decennial census block boundaries.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rental Listings: Sample Construction}
\label{subsec:rental_sample}

The rental listings data contain daily snapshots of active listings from RentHub. Raw variables include listing price, unit characteristics (bedrooms, bathrooms, year built), building type, amenity indicators (laundry, gym), and geographic coordinates.

\paragraph{Sample Restrictions.}
We apply the following restrictions to construct the analysis sample: (1) valid rental price (non-missing and positive); (2) valid geographic coordinates (non-missing latitude and longitude); and (3) successfully geocoded to a Chicago ward.

\paragraph{Spatial Assignment.}
Each listing is assigned to the relevant ward based on its file date and the ward boundaries in effect at that time. The ward map changes on May 18, 2015 (following the 2015 aldermanic elections) and May 15, 2023 (following the 2023 redistricting). Census block assignment uses 2010 blocks for the 2015 cohort and 2020 blocks for the 2023 cohort.

\paragraph{Distance to Ward Boundary.}
For each listing, we calculate the distance to the nearest ward boundary. Shared ward boundaries are constructed via polygon intersection, and the nearest boundary segment is identified using spatial indexing. Distance is computed in the Illinois East State Plane coordinate system (EPSG:3435) and expressed in feet. The signed distance is positive when the listing is in the stricter alderman's ward and negative otherwise.

\paragraph{Building Type Classification.}
Raw building type strings are classified as: Single-family (matches SFR, Single-family, house); Multi-family (matches APT, Apartment, Multi-family, duplex, triplex, fourplex); Condo (matches CON, Condo, Condominium); Townhouse (matches TH, Townhouse); and Other (all remaining).

\subsection{Rental Listings: Summary Statistics}

Table~\ref{tab:rental_sumstats} presents summary statistics for the rental listings sample.

\subsection{Event Study Panel Construction}
\label{subsec:event_study_panel}

For the event study analysis, we construct block-level panels around the 2015 and 2023 redistricting events.

\paragraph{Treatment Assignment.}
Blocks are classified as treated if they were redistricted from one ward to another. For the 2015 cohort, we compare ward assignments under the pre-2015 map (2014 boundaries) to post-2015 (2015 boundaries). For the 2023 cohort, we compare 2022 boundaries to 2024 boundaries. Census blocks are assigned to wards based on their centroid location.

\paragraph{Predetermined Strictness.}
Treatment intensity is measured using predetermined alderman strictness scores---scores computed from permit data in the year before redistricting takes effect. For the 2015 cohort, we use 2014 strictness scores for both origin and destination wards. For the 2023 cohort, we use 2022 scores. This ensures treatment intensity is not affected by post-treatment changes in aldermanic behavior. The change in strictness for block $i$ is: $\Delta\text{Strictness}_i = \text{Strictness}_{\text{dest}} - \text{Strictness}_{\text{origin}}$.

\paragraph{Contaminated Control Exclusion.}
Control blocks may experience treatment through electoral turnover (alderman changed via election rather than redistricting). We identify wards with alderman turnover between 2014--2015 and 2022--2023 and exclude non-switching blocks in these wards from the control group.

\paragraph{Panel Aggregation.}
Rental listings are aggregated to block-year and block-quarter levels. For each block-period, we compute number of listings, mean rent, and median rent. The final panel stacks the 2015 and 2023 cohorts with cohort-specific fixed effects.

\subsection{Alderman Strictness Scores}
\label{subsec:strictness_scores}

Alderman strictness is measured using permit processing times, residualized to remove the influence of ward characteristics.

\paragraph{Stage 1: Residualization.}
We regress log mean processing time on ward geographic fundamentals (distance to CBD, lakefront share, CTA station density, community area shares), demographic controls (homeownership rate, population, median household income, racial composition), and month fixed effects.

\paragraph{Stage 2: Alderman Fixed Effects.}
Residualized processing times are regressed on alderman fixed effects, with observations weighted by the number of permits. The alderman fixed effect captures the systematic component of processing time attributable to the alderman.

\paragraph{Empirical Bayes Shrinkage.}
Raw alderman fixed effects are shrunk toward the grand mean using an empirical Bayes procedure: $\hat{\theta}_j^{\text{EB}} = B_j \cdot \hat{\theta}_j$, where $B_j = \hat{\tau}^2/(\hat{\tau}^2 + \hat{\sigma}_j^2)$ is the shrinkage factor.

\paragraph{Index Standardization.}
The final strictness index is standardized to have mean zero across aldermen. Higher values indicate stricter aldermen.

\subsection{Summary Statistics: New Construction Sample}

Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} presents summary statistics for the new residential construction sample used in the density analysis. The sample includes all new residential buildings constructed in Chicago between 2006 and 2025. Column (1) reports statistics for the full sample, while Column (2) restricts to multifamily buildings with 2 or more units.

The full sample contains 13,236 new residential buildings with an average of 6.65 dwelling units and 2.27 stories. The average Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is 1.22 and the average Dwelling Units Per Acre (DUPAC) is 28.47. Multifamily buildings are substantially denser, with an average of 31.27 units, 2.75 stories, FAR of 2.32, and DUPAC of 74.54. Both samples have similar median distances to the nearest ward boundary (approximately 900 feet).
