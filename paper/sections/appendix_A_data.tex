\subsection{Summary Statistics: New Construction Sample}

Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} presents summary statistics for the new residential construction sample used in the density analysis in Section~\ref{sec:empirical_results_density}. The sample includes all new residential buildings constructed in Chicago between 2006 and 2025. Column (1) reports statistics for the full sample, while Column (2) restricts to multifamily buildings with 2 or more units.

The full sample contains 13,236 new residential buildings with an average of 6.65 dwelling units and 2.27 stories. The average Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is 1.22 and the average Dwelling Units Per Acre (DUPAC) is 28.47. Multifamily buildings are substantially denser, with an average of 31.27 units, 2.75 stories, FAR of 2.32, and DUPAC of 74.54. Both samples have similar median distances to the nearest ward boundary (approximately 900 feet) and positive average strictness scores, though the multifamily sample has a higher average strictness score (0.285 vs 0.154), potentially reflecting higher demand in wards with stricter aldermen.
