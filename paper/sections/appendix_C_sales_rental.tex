\section{Additional Home Sales and Rental Results}
\label{sec:appendix_sales_rental}

This appendix presents additional results for home sale prices and rents, complementing the event study analysis in Section~\ref{sec:empirical_results_rent_home_vals}.

\subsection{Event Study Without Hedonic Controls}

The main text presents event study results including property-level hedonic controls to isolate the pure price effect holding quality constant. This subsection presents results without hedonic controls to capture the total effect of aldermanic strictness on housing costs, including any composition effects operating through changes in the housing stock. Point estimates are generally similar or slightly larger without hedonic controls, suggesting that composition effects account for only a modest portion of the total price response.

\subsubsection{Rents Without Hedonic Controls}

Figure~\ref{fig:event_study_rental_no_hedonics} presents event study results for rents without hedonic controls. The pattern is qualitatively similar to the main specification: flat pre-trends followed by a clear break at redistricting. Point estimates are slightly larger, consistent with part of the effect operating through changes in housing stock composition.

Post-period truncated at $t=2$ where both cohorts contribute observations. 95\% confidence intervals based on standard errors clustered at the census block level.}

\subsubsection{Home Sale Prices Without Hedonic Controls}

Figure~\ref{fig:event_study_sales_no_hedonics} presents event study results for home sales without hedonic controls for building square footage, land square footage, building age, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and garage presence. The pattern is qualitatively similar to the main specification with hedonic controls.
