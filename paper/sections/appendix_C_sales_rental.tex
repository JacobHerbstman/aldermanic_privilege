\section{Additional Home Sales and Rental Results}
\label{sec:appendix_sales_rental}

This appendix presents additional results for home sale prices and rents, complementing the event study analysis in Section~\ref{sec:empirical_results_rent_home_vals}.

\subsection{Pooled Difference-in-Differences Estimates}

Table~\ref{tab:did_sales} presents pooled difference-in-differences estimates that collapse the post-period effects into a single coefficient. Panel A reports results for home sales, comparing announcement timing (2012) to implementation timing (2015). The cleaner pre-trends with announcement timing in Figure~\ref{fig:event_study_sales} are reflected in larger and more precisely estimated coefficients. Panel B reports results for rents using implementation timing. Across all specifications, moving to a stricter alderman is associated with higher housing costs.

\subsection{Event Study with Hedonic Controls}

The main text presents event study results without property-level controls to capture the total effect of aldermanic strictness on housing costs, including any composition effects operating through changes in the housing stock. This subsection presents results controlling for property characteristics to isolate the pure price effect holding quality constant.

\subsubsection{Home Sale Prices with Hedonic Controls}

Figure~\ref{fig:event_study_sales_hedonics} presents event study results for home sales including hedonic controls for building square footage, land square footage, building age, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and garage presence. Point estimates are somewhat attenuated relative to the main specification, consistent with the interpretation that part of the price effect operates through changes in housing stock composition. The post-period coefficients remain positive, though less precisely estimated.

\subsubsection{Rents with Hedonic Controls}

Figure~\ref{fig:event_study_rental_hedonics} presents event study results for rents including hedonic controls for building type, square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. As with home sales, point estimates are attenuated relative to the main specification, suggesting that composition effects account for part of the total rent response to aldermanic strictness.
