\section{Event Study Evidence: Home Prices and Rents}
\label{sec:empirical_results_rent_home_vals}

\subsection{Event Study Design}
The cross-sectional evidence in Section \ref{sec:empirical_results_density} establishes that new construction is less dense on the stricter side of ward boundaries.
While density on its own is an important outcome, policymakers tend to be more interested in its implications for housing affordability.
To look at downstream effects on home values and rents, I exploit the 2015 and 2023 ward redistrictings as natural experiments to examine how home prices and rents respond when parcels are reassigned to aldermen with different levels of strictness.

\subsection{Identification Strategy and Empirical Specification}
Ward boundaries in Chicago are redrawn following each decennial census to equalize populations across the city's 50 wards. The 2015 remap (based on the 2010 Census) and the 2023 remap (based on the 2020 Census) each reassigned many parcels to new aldermen while leaving nearby parcels under the same ward. This creates a difference-in-differences style comparison: census blocks that switched aldermen (treated) versus blocks near the same ward boundary that did not switch (control). The identifying assumption is that, absent the change in aldermanic representation, treated and control blocks would have followed parallel trends in housing costs.

This design exploits the fact that ward boundaries shift for reasons unrelated to housing market conditions in specific census blocks. Redistricting in Chicago occurs every ten years following the decennial census, with boundaries redrawn to equalize population across wards. The resulting boundary changes create quasi-random variation in alderman assignment for blocks near the old and new boundaries.

Figure~\ref{fig:identification_illustration} illustrates this design. Panel A shows a concrete example for a single ward pair (Wards 13 and 23) during the 2015 redistricting. The left subpanel shows ward assignments before redistricting, the center subpanel shows assignments after, and the right subpanel shows the resulting treatment status based on the change in alderman strictness. Blocks that switched from Ward 13 to Ward 23 are classified as ``moved to stricter'' or ``moved to lenient'' depending on the relative strictness scores of the two aldermen, while blocks that did not switch wards serve as controls.

Panels B and C of Figure~\ref{fig:identification_illustration} show the geographic distribution of treatment and control blocks for the 2015 and 2023 redistricting events, respectively. In both cases, treated blocks (those that switched aldermen) are dispersed throughout the city, interspersed with control blocks that did not switch. This spatial dispersion supports the assumption that treated and control blocks are comparable conditional on location near ward boundaries.


I conduct the analysis at the census block level rather than the parcel level for a practical reason: individual parcels rarely transact more than once within my sample window, making it impossible to construct a balanced panel at the parcel level. By aggregating to census blocks, I can track average prices and rents over time within small, relatively homogeneous geographic units while maintaining sufficient observations in each period.

I stack both redistricting events to maximize statistical power. For each event, I restrict the sample to census blocks where the mean distance of transacted parcels (or rental listings) is less than 1,000 feet to ensure that treated and control blocks are in close geographic proximity and thus subject to similar local demand shocks and neighborhood trends.

\begin{equation}
y_{bpet} = \alpha_b + \lambda_{et} + \sum_{\tau=-5, \tau \neq -1}^{5} \beta_\tau \left( \text{Strictness}_b \times \mathbf{1}[t = \tau] \right) + \varepsilon_{bpet}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $y_{bpet}$ is the outcome (log mean sale price or log mean rent) for census block $b$ along border-pair $p$ in event cohort $e$ (2015 or 2023 remap) at time $t$. $\text{Strictness}_b$ is the strictness score of the post-remap alderman for block $b$, as defined in Section \ref{sec:empirical_results_density}. In the continuous treatment specification, this enters as a continuous variable; I also present binary specifications below. $\alpha_b$ are census block fixed effects, which absorb time-invariant neighborhood characteristics. $\lambda_{et}$ are event-by-year fixed effects, allowing for different time trends across the two redistricting episodes. 
Standard errors are clustered at the census block level to account for serial correlation.

The coefficients $\beta_\tau$ trace out the effect of aldermanic strictness on housing costs in event time, with $\tau = -1$ (the year before each remap took effect) as the omitted reference period. The identifying assumption implies $\beta_\tau = 0$ for $\tau < 0$: prior to each remap, there should be no systematic relationship between future alderman strictness and housing cost trends.

I restrict the sample to census blocks where the average parcel distance to a ward boundary is within 1000 feet to focus on locations where treated and control blocks are most comparable in terms of neighborhood characteristics and local demand conditions.

If stricter aldermen constrain housing supply, standard urban economics predicts that both home prices and rents should rise in affected areas. I test this prediction using two complementary data sources: home sale prices from the Cook County Assessor's Office and rental listings from RentHub.

Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats_event_study} presents summary statistics for the event study sample. The sample includes over 25,000 block-cohort pairs for home sales and over 24,000 for rentals, observed over an 11-year window around each redistricting event. Treated blocks that moved to stricter aldermen have slightly lower mean sale prices and homeownership rates than controls, while blocks that moved to more lenient aldermen are broadly similar to controls on observables. The balance across treatment groups supports the identifying assumption that redistricting-induced changes in alderman assignment are orthogonal to pre-existing neighborhood trends.

\subsection{Results: Home Sale Prices}
\label{sec:results_home_prices}

Figure \ref{fig:event_study_sales} presents the main event study results for home sale prices. Panel A shows the continuous treatment specification, where treatment intensity is measured by the strictness score of the post-remap alderman. The coefficients trace out the effect of moving to an alderman who is one standard deviation stricter, relative to prices in the year before the remap.

Following the redistricting, home prices in areas assigned to stricter aldermen diverge sharply from the reference period. By year 3 after the remap, a one standard deviation increase in alderman strictness is associated with approximately 5\% higher home prices. This effect persists through year 5, suggesting a permanent level shift rather than a transitory response.

Panel B presents the binary specification, which relaxes the linearity assumption and allows for separate effects by treatment direction. Here, treatment is defined as switching to an alderman with a higher ``strictness score'' (``moved to stricter''), or the reverse (``moved to more lenient''), with the control group consisting of census blocks that did not switch aldermen.

The binary results reveal a striking divergence. Census blocks reassigned to stricter aldermen experience roughly 8--10\% higher home prices in the post-period, while blocks reassigned to more lenient aldermen experience flat or slightly declining prices. This asymmetry is difficult to reconcile with confounding explanations that would predict symmetric effects, and supports the interpretation that aldermanic strictness causally affects housing costs through the supply restriction channel documented in Section \ref{sec:empirical_results_density}.

These results are robust to alternative specifications. Weighting observations by the number of sales in each census block-year cell yields similar point estimates, as does including time-varying demographic controls for median household income, racial composition, and homeownership rates. These robustness checks are reported in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_sales_rental}.

\paragraph{Interpretation.} The event study estimates complement the cross-sectional density results from Section \ref{sec:empirical_results_density}. The border discontinuity estimates showed that new construction is 10--16\% less dense on the stricter side of ward boundaries. If supply restrictions bind, standard urban economics models predict that reduced housing supply should capitalize into higher prices. The event study confirms this prediction: census blocks exogenously reassigned to stricter aldermen experience rising home prices relative to nearby blocks that were not reassigned.

The magnitude is economically meaningful. A 5\% increase in home prices corresponds to approximately \$13,500 for the median home in my sample, representing a substantial transfer from buyers to incumbent homeowners. Combined with the density results, these findings suggest that aldermanic privilege has quantitatively important effects on both housing supply and affordability and allows incumbent homeowners to extract rents through political channels.

\subsection{Results: Rents}
\label{sec:results_rents}

Figure \ref{fig:event_study_rents} presents the analogous event study results for rental listings. Panel A shows the continuous treatment specification. The pattern is qualitatively similar to the home price results: pre-period coefficients, while noisy, are not significantly different from zero in the years immediately preceding alderman reassignment and then gradually rise over the post period. 
5 years after being reassigned to an alderman one standard deviation stricter, rents increase roughly $2-3\%$ relative to census blocks in the same ward-border pair that did not switch aldermen.

The rental estimates are less precise than the home price estimates. Nevertheless, the post-period coefficients are statistically significant at conventional levels, and the monotonically increasing pattern is consistent with the gradual restriction of housing supply slowly matriculating into higher rents over time.

Panel B shows the binary specification for rents. While the estimates are noisier, the pattern is again consistent with a gradual divergence between blocks reassigned to stricter versus more lenient aldermen. While I cannot reject the effects are equivalent between blocks that switched to stricter versus more lenient aldermen, the same $\approx 3\%$ increase in rents still opens up by year 5 in the post-period. 

The rental results are more suggestive than definitive, but are robust to different specifications as can be seen in appendix \ref{sec:appendix_sales_rental}. 
Combined with the evidence on home prices, these results suggest that alderman that induce more restrictions on housing supply through their aldermanic privilege ultimately raise housing costs and rents. 
However, the amenity channel through which home prices rise due to implicit future restrictions on multifamily development in that ward could explain why home prices rise more than rents.

As with the home price results, weighting by the number of listings in each census block-year cell and including demographic controls yields similar estimates. 
These specifications are reported in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_sales_rental}.
